Core Scoring Logic
function gradeTest() {
  let total = 0;
  const questions = document.querySelectorAll('.question');
  questions.forEach(q => {
    const correct = q.dataset.answer.trim().toLowerCase();
    const selected = q.querySelector('input[type="radio"]:checked');
    if (selected && selected.value.trim().toLowerCase() === correct) {
      total++;
      q.classList.add('correct');
    } else {
      q.classList.add('incorrect');
    }
  });
  alert(`✅ Test Complete! Your Score: ${total} / ${questions.length}`);
}
